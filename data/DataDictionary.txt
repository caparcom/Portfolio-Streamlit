Below is the Data Dictionary for our ExoPlanet data, provided by NASA

pl_name: Planet name most commonly used in the literature

pl_rade: Length of a line segment from the center of the planet to its surface, 
    measured in units of radius of the Earth

pl_bmasse: Best planet mass estimate available, in order of preference: 
    Mass, M*sin(i)/sin(i), or M*sin(i), depending on availability, 
    and measured in Earth masses

pl_orbper: Time the planet takes to make a complete orbit around the host star or system

pl_eqt: The equilibrium temperature of the planet as modeled by a black body 
    heated only by its host star, or for directly imaged planets, 
    the effective temperature of the planet required to match the measured 
    luminosity if the planet were a black body

st_teff: Temperature of the star as modeled by a black body emitting
    the same total amount of electromagnetic radiation

st_rad: Length of a line segment from the center of the star to its surface,
    measured in units of radius of the Sun
