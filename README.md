# Welcome to my Data Science portfolio!

I’m Caleb, a data science student with a passion for the interesting.

This repository contains a Streamlit web app that serves as a home for my data science projects. Each project revolves around applied analysis, modeling, and interpretation, with a focus on understanding real data rather than just producing code.
